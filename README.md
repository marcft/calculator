# Web Calculator

Welcome to the Web Calculator project! This is a simple web calculator that allows you to perform basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also accepts decimal numbers for more precise calculations. The calculator's interface is divided into two parts: the upper display shows the ongoing operations, while the lower display shows the current number being entered. Additionally, if a result of an operation is too long, the calculator will truncate it to fit the display.
